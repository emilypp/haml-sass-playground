This is a Compass project to play
with Sass, Haml and Compass.

To learn about Sass and Haml, go to
sass-lang.com and haml-lang.com.
Learn more about compass at compass-style.org.

You should have the appropriate gems on your machine already,
but you will need haml, sass, and compass. Install these by 
running gem install [gem].

To write markup, edit input.haml with your haml code,
and run haml input.haml output.haml to compile it.
Open output.html in your browser (double clicking the file
should work) to see your changes.

To work on the Sass/Compass, edit sass/screen.scss and 
run compass compile. This will compile your sass into
the screen.css loaded in the input.haml (and therefore output)
file. Only screen.css is loaded at the moment, feel free to
try out adding new sheets and style tags.

Have fun!
